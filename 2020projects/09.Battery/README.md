# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info
     1. Name: 
     2. Date: 
     3. Section:
     4. Sensor/Effector choice: Battery
2. I will make a circuit to support a USB serial device that will allow for regulated battery power and for charging via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). This can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. They can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term. 
3. Preliminary Bill of Materials
    1. OPL: [ShenZhen](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html)
    2. MPN: MCP73831/2
	3. Qty: 1
	4. Link: 
    5. Description:	IC CONTROLLER LI-ION 4.2V
	6. Manufacturer: Microchip
	7. Package: SOT23-5 (SC-74A，SOT-753) or 8DFN (8-VFDFN)
4. Specifications
    1. What does it sense/effect?
	2. How accurate is it?
    3. Voltage range:
	4. Current draw:
	5. Protocol:
	6. Additional components needed: 2 capacitors, 4 resistors, 2 LEDs, JST connector, and a battery (e.g. Adafruit Product ID: 2750)
