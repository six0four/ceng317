# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info
     1. Name: 
     2. Date: 
     3. Section:
     4. Sensor/Effector choice: STLink-master
2. I will make a USB serial device that will be able to program STM32s via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). This can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. It can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term. 
3. Preliminary Bill of Materials
    1. OPL: [ShenZhen](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html)
    2. MPN: STM32F103C8T6

    5. Description:	IC MCU 32BIT 64KB FLASH 48LQFP
	6. Manufacturer: ST
	7. Package: LQFP-48
4. Specifications
    1. Voltage range:
