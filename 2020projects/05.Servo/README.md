# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info
     1. Name: 
     2. Date: 
     3. Section:
     4. Sensor/Effector choice: Servo
2. I will make a USB serial device that will (choose: send output from a sensor, or, receive input for an effector) via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). This can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. They can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term. 
3. Preliminary Bill of Materials
    1. OPL: [Shenzen or Seeed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html)
    2. MPN: 74HCT245PW (Shenzen) or 74VHC125MTCX (Seeed) may be able to be used in place of CD4050BE
