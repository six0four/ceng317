   <ul>
    <li>Start off by logging into a computer and during the log in process identify ten items as per your quiz sheet, this is an individual quiz to be done without communicating with others.</li>
	<li>The maximum size of your project is in alignment with the space below the tray in your Humber North Campus Electronics Parts kit, you are expected to bring both along with safety glasses every week otherwise there is a minimum one mark deduction on the week's submission.</li>
	<li>If your computer has booted:</li>
	<ol>
	 <li>If not already installed, please install <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a></li>

    <li>Welcome to your IoT themed hardware projects. Let's get started with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM-DXWEns2Y&t=28s">reflective learning.</a></li>
	<li>Blackboard (Bio, Outline, Critical Path, Weeks).</li>
	<li>Electives schedules - Tech Club is Wednesdays 5pm-7pm in the Prototype Lab (J233).</li>
	<li>Regarding computer issues please report them to ITS by using this form to bring downed computers to their attention for repair:

      <li>Getting started with a single board microcomputer - Half Hour Familiarization with Device from Humber Parts Crib:
	   <ol>
	    <li>The single board microcomputer, comprised of a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU with 1GB SDRAM, 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet, GPIO, UART, I2C bus, SPI bus, and 8 GB
         of Secure Digital storage from the Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning North Campus Technology Parts Crib can be tried out by following:
         <a href="https://six0four.github.io/StudentSenseHat/cribpi.html">getting started https://six0four.github.io/StudentSenseHat/cribpi.html</a>.</li>
        <li>The following case for is used for the parts crib Broadcom development platforms (a Pi 3 also fits) http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html and we bought the USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct.</li>
		<li>Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific camera modules.</li>
		<li>More detailed instructions are available on Lynda.com plus Paul Moggach's technical notes. It turns outs that the newest version of Rasbian has realvnc-vnc-server installed by default which conflicts with xrdp.</li>
		<li>Instead of installing xrdp on your development platform you can install VNC Viewer on your desktop to connect instead of using Remote Desktop Connection.</li>
		<li>The boot options still need to be set along with ensuring VNC (and I2C) is enabled via Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces and such an image is in the DropBoxes as before.</li>
		<li>Please let me know if you have had success purging realvnc-vnc-server and installing then using xrdp. Something along the lines of sudo apt-get purge realvnc-vnc-server, sudo apt-get install xrdp, plus relevant configuration.</li>
